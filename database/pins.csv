Class Candy,Chicago,BY-NC-SA,41.83,-87.62,Near South Side,"I was in my house, and someone I know was doing the washing up and singing that song. And in another room, I think there was a song playing on the radio. And the layout of the house means that if you're in one room you can't hear what's going on in the other. But I stood between the two rooms, and there was this incredible sound clash that sounded really stunning.",https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/05/02/308952301/these-new-puritans-you-have-to-be-meticulous,Iko!
